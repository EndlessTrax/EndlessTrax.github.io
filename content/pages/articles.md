### Books

**Fighting To Survive** *(published under the pen name Rick Pine)*

He’s been in hiding for 10 years. But the time for hiding is over…

Casey Russo thought he’d put his dark past behind him. Working for a friend at his remote farm kept him far away from the tyrannical Cosa Nostra—the mafia overlords who overthrew the U.S. in the ashes of The Last War. But you can’t run forever. When the Cosa Nostra abducts his friend’s son, Casey knows he’s the only one who can keep the boy from meeting a bloody end in the fighting pits…

With the help of a foul-mouthed teen girl with one hell of a right hook, the rescue mission takes Casey deep into enemy territory. To steal back the boy from the heart of corruption, Casey’s only chance is to join the rebellion he hoped to ignore. And achieving his mission may just involve taking down an empire…

Fighting to Survive is the pulse-pounding first book in a series of dystopian sci-fi novels. If you like white-knuckle action, complex characters, and original worlds, then you’ll love Rick Pine’s gritty adventure.

**Taking Charge: Making Your Healthcare Appointments Work For You**

This book is for you if:

- you often feel anxious or nervous before your healthcare appointments.

- you leave your healthcare appointments feeling frustrated.

- you leave your healthcare appointments with more questions than you went in with.

- you feel left out of the decisions being made about your treatment or overall care.

- you have trouble keeping track of all the changes in your care.

- you find that your appointments just aren’t long enough to answer all your questions and address all your concerns.

- you feel your care isn’t coordinated between all your healthcare professionals.

Whatever your reason, you can learn how to get more from your healthcare appointments.

While working as a Registered Nurse, I was diagnosed with a degenerative autoimmune disease. I have spent countless hours in and out of various healthcare appointments, and the one thing that helped me the most was my experience of sitting on both sides of the desk.

Just because you haven’t had that experience firsthand, it doesn’t mean you can’t learn how to make your healthcare appointments work for you, too.

Why this book?

- It will be the handbook you need for all your appointments, regardless of who you’re seeing.

- It’s presented in an easy-to-read format (no jargon.)

- You will discover what healthcare professionals expect from you.

- It will help you maximize your time at your appointments so you can get more done.

- It will help you bridge the gap in your doctor-patient relationship.

- It includes FREE downloadable resources to give you a head-start.
